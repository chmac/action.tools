* [x] Add a `by:today`, `by:thisweek`, `by:overdue`, `by:next30days` filters
* [x] Date filters could be "now", "all", or "now&undated"
  - Right now it's only 2 or 3, but arguably 1 is more useful
* [x] Lessen the highlight of `after` dates in the past
* [ ] Add a refresh button to refetch from git
* [ ] Add a view / edit single task scene
  - Title, after, by, priroity, repeat, context, snooze
* [ ] Hide empty sections when filtering
* [ ] Add created dates to all tasks
* [ ] Warn for `by` dates before `after` dates
* [ ] Decide if `by date` or `by:date` makes sense
* [ ] Consider adding a unique (to the file) ID to each task

# Bugs

* [x] After dates do not match for "exact date"
* [ ] Git revision does not land in UI on netlify
